# Iterator Design Pattern in C#

This repository contains a C# implementation of the Iterator design pattern. 

The Iterator pattern provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its internal structure. This pattern promotes separation of concerns and simplifies the process of iterating through collections.

## Implementation Details

### Iterator Interface

The `IIterator<T>` interface defines methods for iterating over a collection:

- `bool HasNext()`: Checks if there is another element to iterate over.
- `T Next()`: Returns the next element in the collection.

### Aggregate Interface

The `IAggregate<T>` interface declares a method for creating an iterator:

- `IIterator<T> CreateIterator()`: Returns an instance of an iterator.

### Concrete Iterator

The `ConcreteIterator<T>` class implements the `IIterator<T>` interface and keeps track of the current position within the collection. It allows sequential access to elements of the collection.

### Concrete Aggregate

The `ConcreteAggregate<T>` class implements the `IAggregate<T>` interface and holds the collection. It provides a method for creating a concrete iterator that iterates over the collection.

## Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: The Iterator pattern separates the logic for iterating over a collection from the collection itself, making the code more modular and maintainable.

- **Encapsulation**: The internal structure of the collection is encapsulated within the aggregate, preventing direct access to the collection's elements.

- **Flexibility**: It allows for multiple iterators to work on the same collection independently.

- **Easier Client Code**: Client code can iterate over collections without worrying about their specific implementations.

## Drawbacks

- **Complexity**: Implementing the Iterator pattern can introduce additional complexity, especially in cases with complex data structures.

- **Performance Overhead**: In some cases, creating iterator objects may introduce a slight performance overhead.

- **Limited Support in Standard Collections**: Many standard collections in C# already provide built-in iterators (e.g., `foreach` loops), so implementing the Iterator pattern may not always be necessary.


Happy coding!
